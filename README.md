- **Collaborations** between artists (e.g., **Sam Smith & Kim Petras, Bizarrap & Quevedo**) have **higher popularity scores**, indicating the influence of **featured artists**.  
- **A mix of genres** is represented, with pop, reggaeton, and hip-hop leading the charts.  
- **International influence** is evident, with artists from **Latin America, the U.S., and global pop scenes**.  

### 2. General Findings from the Data  

#### ‚úÖ Popularity & Artist Influence  
- Our analysis revealed that **collaborations between artists** tend to have higher popularity scores (e.g., *Sam Smith & Kim Petras* and *Bizarrap & Quevedo*).  
- Certain artists like **Bad Bunny** appear multiple times, indicating **strong dominance in the industry**.  

#### ‚úÖ Genre Diversity & Music Trends  
- The dataset includes a **wide variety of genres**, showing that recommendations should consider more than just popularity.  
- Some **less mainstream artists** still achieved high popularity, proving that emerging artists can attract large audiences.  

#### ‚úÖ Audio Features & Music Similarity  
- Audio features like **danceability, energy, and tempo** showed strong correlations with genre and popularity.  
- Songs within **similar audio feature clusters** are likely to be perceived as related, justifying the use of **Autoencoders** to extract meaningful latent features.  

### 3. Interpretation of our model Results  
- The **Autoencoder effectively captured latent artist similarities**, transforming high-dimensional features into compact embeddings.  
- With an **MSE of 0.0748**, the model demonstrated **strong reconstruction ability**, preserving essential artist relationships.  
- The model allows for **efficient and scalable artist recommendations**, suitable for integration into streaming services.
